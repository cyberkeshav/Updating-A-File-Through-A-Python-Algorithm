<h1>Updating A File Through Python Algorithm</h1>

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Phython</b> 

<h2>Description</h2>

At my (fictitious) organization, access to restricted content is controlled with an allow list of IP addresses. The "allow_list.txt" file identifies these IP addresses. A separate remove list identifies IP addresses that should no longer have access to this content. I created an algorithm to automate updating the "allow_list.txt" file and remove these IP addresses that should no longer have access. 

<br />

<h2>Opening the file that contains the allow list</h2>

For the first part of the algorithm, I opened the "allow_list.txt" file. First, I assigned this file name as a string to the import_file variable:

Then, I used a 'with' statement to open the file:
